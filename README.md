## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (React), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/)
- **Backend**: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- **Database**: [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) with [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) ORM
- **Video Processing**: [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) (via `fluent-ffmpeg` and `ffmpeg-static`)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- npm

## Setup & Running

### Using Docker (Recommended)

This is the easiest way to get up and running locally.

1.  **Prerequisites**: Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.
2.  **Start Services**:
    ```bash
    docker compose up --build
    ```
3.  **Access App**: Open `http://localhost:3100` in your browser.

- The Backend is running internally and is NOT exposed publicly.
- `dev.db`, `recordings/`, and `uploads/` are mounted as volumes for persistence.

### Manual Setup (Development)

If you want to run the services individually for development:

#### 1. Backend

The backend handles file storage, database operations, and video processing. It runs on port **5005**.

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```
- API URL: `http://localhost:5005/api`
- Static Files: `http://localhost:5005/recordings`

### 2. Frontend

The frontend provides the user interface for recording and managing videos. It runs on port **3000**.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

- App URL: `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

1.  Open the application in your browser (`http://localhost:3100` for Docker, `http://localhost:3000` for manual).
2.  Click **"New Recording"** to start the recording flow.
3.  Grant necessary permissions for screen and microphone access.
4.  After recording, save your video.
5.  Use the dashboard to view, watermark, or export your recordings.

## Troubleshooting

- **Ports**: Ensure ports 5005 and 5006 are free.
- **Permissions**: You must allow camera/microphone access in your browser when prompted.
- **Video Export**: Exporting uses FFmpeg. Ensure your system can run the static binaries provided by `ffmpeg-static`.
